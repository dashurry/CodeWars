The rules for the triangle are as follows:

If the two touching colors in a row are the same, the new row will use the same color.
If the two touching colors in a row are different, the new row will use the remaining color.
We can solve this problem by starting from the first row and applying these rules repeatedly until we reach the final row. We can do this by iterating over the elements in the row and applying the rules to each pair of touching colors.

Here is a possible implementation in JavaScript:
function triangle(row) {
  // Keep applying the rules until we reach the final row
  while (row.length > 1) {
    // Start with an empty string for the new row
    let newRow = "";
    
    // Iterate over the elements in the row
    for (let i = 0; i < row.length - 1; i++) {
      // Get the two touching colors
      let color1 = row[i];
      let color2 = row[i + 1];
      
      // Apply the rules and add the resulting color to the new row
      if (color1 == color2) {
        newRow += color1;
      } else {
        newRow += "BGR".replace(color1, "").replace(color2, "");
      }
    }
    
    // Replace the old row with the new row
    row = newRow;
  }
  
  // Return the final color in the row
  return row;
}
